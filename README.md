# Git Workshop Exercises

## How this repo works
- `main` is the safe baseline (don’t rewrite history here).
- Each exercise has a starting branch named: `exercise/<topic>-start`
- You will create your own branch from the start branch:
  - `git switch exercise/<topic>-start`
  - `git switch -c student/<yourname>-<topic>`

## Exercises
- exercises/01-rebase.md
- exercises/02-cherry-pick.md
- exercises/03-reflog.md
- exercises/04-search.md
